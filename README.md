#### Course Description

Course Description
Data collection and algorithmic processing are not only central to recent technical breakthroughs such as in Artificial Intelligence and automation but have created new economic paradigms where data equals value and shape political approaches to power and control.

Decisions based on algorithms affect society at large whether it‚Äôs changing the way we transport and distribute goods, influencing the things we buy or the news we read. The world that algorithms see is data. For the average person, however, data is seldom more than an abstract idea.

So, what exactly is data? How is value extracted from it? And why should we care? How can we ethically balance the positive uses of data-driven systems with the threats they pose to discriminate and infringe basic human rights? This course seeks to untangle some of these issues practically and theoretically.

#### Assignments:

Due this Wednesday (2020/02/19):
- Do this assignment first (strongly recommended)
-  We will spend 50% of our time in this course coding. Having a shared foundation for this is **extremely important**. I will always be there to support and assist you with problems you encounter. For now, please work your way through [Coding Foundation: Setup and Exercises](coding-foundation) and submit your work in the end.
- Here is a thorough, interactive ``basic-javascript`` tutorial if you want to brush up your skills: [Basic JavaScript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/). And [here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) is Codecadey's version.

Due Monday (2020/02/24):
- Read [**Critical Questions for Big Data**](readings/boyd_crawford_2012.pdf) by danah boyd and Kate Crawford. The linked version has some intentional notes that will help you. Please read the whole text despite below prompts being pointed at specific sections. There is no right or wrong, **what counts more than anything is your own opinion**. For each prompt, write no more than a short paragraph:
  - Introduction and Chapter 2
    - Why does Bowker say "'*Raw data is both and oxymoron and a bad idea*'" ? (pp. 663)
  - Section 1 (pp. 665)
    - What could be meant by the quote "'*accounting tools [...] do not simply aid the measurement of economic activity, they shape the reality they measure*'"?
  - Section 3 and 4 (pp. 668)
    - In which way is Twitter data limited?
  - Section 5 (pp. 671)
    - If you don't need to login to obtain certain data, then it is public and free to use. Or isn't it? Please share your opinion.
  - Section 6
    - No prompts here, but a very well written chapter that is relevant to everything we will be talking about this semester. Please enjoy.

- **How to submit the homework**:
  - First, find or create a folder in your repository (e.g. `my-work/week1/reading-response/`). In there, create a `README.md` file.
  - In this file, do your writing (if you want, [format your text nicely](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)).
  - When you are done, [push your changes to your repository](other/how-to-submit-assigments) as you learned in the [Coding Foundation Exercise](coding-foundation) and paste a link to the [class wiki](https://github.com/leoneckert/critical-data-and-visualization-spring-2020/wiki).

#### Assignments:

Due **THIS** Wednesday (2020/03/04):
- Upload a JSON file of the data you have so far self-collected to your repository and post a link to the [class wiki](https://github.com/leoneckert/critical-data-and-visualization-spring-2020/wiki).

Due Monday (2020/03/09):
- "[Automating Inequality](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250074317)" (2018) is a fantastic book by Virginia Eubanks that addresses specifically the *who* -- who is impacted by the process of *datafication* of society we discuss in this class. The book discusses the *who* that is not individuals, but groups of people.
  - This week, you don't have to read (you may if you wish; I can make the book available to you), but listen to an interview with the author Virginia Eubanks.
    -  "Writer's Voice, Automating Inequality w Virginia Eubanks" (**1 hour**)
      - [web link](https://www.writersvoice.net/tag/virginia-eubanks/), [Apple Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/virginia-eubanks-automating-inequality/id268934105?i=1000454045481), it's on Spotify, too, but I cannot link to it for a strange reason, search for `Virginia Eubanks, AUTOMATING INEQUALITY` and find this image:
      - ![automating inqequality](other/assets/ve.png)
  - Formulate short responses to the following prompts, no more than **400-500 words in total**.
    - How to technical tools promise to "fair out" the remaining discrimination that exist in social/welfare systems? In how far can they succeed, in which ways do they fail?
    - Imagine, what could this (following quotes) mean in the widest sense?
      > "*The state doesn't need a cop to kill a person*" and "*electronic incarceration*"
    - What do you understand this to mean?
      > "*systems act as a kind of 'empathy-overwrite'*"
    - China is much more advanced and expansive when it comes to applying technical solutions to societal processes or instant challenges ([recent example](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/china-coronavirus-surveillance.html?)). Try to point example cases in China that are in accordance or in opposition to the problematics discussed in the podcast. Perhaps you can think of
      > "*technical systems not well thought-through about what their impace on human beings is*"
  - Post your writing to the [class wiki](https://github.com/leoneckert/critical-data-and-visualization-spring-2020/wiki).
- Watch [Machine Learning and Human Bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59bMh59JQDo) (**3 minutes**)
- Watch [How I'm fighting bias in algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG_X_7g63rY) by Joy Buolamwini (**9 minutes**)




#### Course Overview and Learning Outcomes

The overarching goal of this course is for students to gain the tools and the comfort to think critically about the ways data is utilized in the ever-growing technological landscape we are immersed in. With this in mind, the course is split in two weekly sessions: a theoretical class and a practical lab.

The classes include lectures introducing contemporary theorists, artists, groups, and in-class discussions or exercises. Themes guiding this exploration include ‚ÄúHuman / Bias‚Äù, ‚ÄúPrediction & Uncertainty‚Äù, ‚ÄúSurveillance Capitalism‚Äù, ‚ÄúEthics & Privacy‚Äù, ‚ÄúPower & Control‚Äù and ‚ÄúResistance‚Äù. In the weekly lab, students will learn the fundamentals of web-based data visualization using JavaScript. The purpose of this is to understand what data feels like through hands-on experimentation and what data says or doesn‚Äôt say by rendering the information it carries visually.

Upon Completion of this Course, students will be able to:
- **map** actors, their roles and relations within a broader data infrastructure.
- **identify** problematics of "datafication" and **generate** ideas for response.
- **identify** various visions, values and cultures inherent to datasets.
- **build** data visualizations for the web.
- **build** their own datasets.
- **make** use of data APIs and scraped data.
- **visually** communicate information pertaining to a given dataset.
- **critique** their own work and others' constructively.
